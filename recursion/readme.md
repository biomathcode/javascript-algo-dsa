RECURSION: is a mindset 
if you are doing iterations more than 2 times than use recursion and the work load is heirarchi

Call Stack Game:

## Recusion in 4 Steps 

1. Identify base case(s).
2. Identify recursive case(s).
3. Return where appropriate.
4. Write procedures for each case that bring you closer to the base case(s).

```js
var callMyself = function() {

  if() {
    // base case
    return;
  } else {
    // recursive case
    callMyself();
  }
    
  return;
};

```

A good way to get comfortable with recursion is to make loops into recursion and recursion into loops. Basically interconvert Loops into recursion
