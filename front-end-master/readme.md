How to convert an n^2 solution to a linear solution ?
Problem 1: for example your have function is_unique which returns true if all the elements in the array are unique, else false.

Solution 1 would be to have a double nested loop and compare the array element one by one and if two element are same return false
Solution 2 would be to keep a memory of each element if it is already present and then return false. 


Problem 2: return a sorted unique array. 

We are trading our space complexity than time complexity
